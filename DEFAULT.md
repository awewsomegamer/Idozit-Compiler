# Defaults

## Lexer, Parser, and Semantic Analyzer


## Code Generator
The default code generator writes x86-64 machine code from the tree generated from the default lexer and parser. **Ensure that the code generator is compatible with the lexer, parser, and semantic analyzer**

## Message Handler
The default message handler has four different levels of messages:
* FATAL_ERROR
* ERROR
* WARNING
* DEBUG

### Fatal Error
Is a message type letting the programmer know of an error which could not be recovered from, resulting in the termination of the program. **For any message handler that is not default, ensure that this case of message results in the immediate termination of compilation**.

### Error
Is a message type letting the programmer know of a regular error, it is not recommended to run any code generated by the compiler that led to an error message.

### Warning
Is a message type letting the programmer know of a possible problem within their code, or something that may go wrong during the compilation sequence.

### Debug
Is a message type that is not printed when the DEBUG definition in design1.h is set to 0. This type of message lets the programmer know of the current step the compiler is taking.
